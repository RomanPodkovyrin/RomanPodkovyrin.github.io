# About Roman

Hello, my name is Roman and I am interested in Computer Science and Photography. While my day job is being a Software Engineer, my passion is Photography (Especially Street Photography).

So, I have decided to make a website where I can ramble about both of the things I love. Hope you enjoy.

Roman
